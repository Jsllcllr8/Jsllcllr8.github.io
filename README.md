Hi, My name is joselle and i am currently studying Information systems, i actually did not chose this path, I wanted to be a Marine Engineer but due to my weak lungs, i was not able to pursue the career that i really want although, even if Information systems is not the path that i chose, i still manage to love this and now what i wanted has changed. As a student who liked marine engineer i now wanted to be a Web Designer someday, this course changed me as well as my classmates, it did not stopped me from achieving dreams.
